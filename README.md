# Test Task: Employee Manager (Frontend)

## Task Overview
In this test task, you are required to implement the frontend part for an employee manager. You should create a user interface that interacts with a RESTful API to retrieve and add employees.

### Implemented Functionality

- Displaying a list of employees with pagination, where each page contains 6 employees.
- Implement a "Load More" button that allows loading the next batch of employees.
- Form for adding a new employee with fields for entering the name and position.
- Enable the addition of a new employee to the list by submitting the form.

### Interaction with RESTful API:

- Use HTTP requests to retrieve a list of employees and add a new employee.
- Handle server responses and display the results on the user interface.

### Displaying Employees:

- Display information about each employee, such as their name and position.
- Display the total number of employees.

## Technologies
The following technologies were used to implement this task:

- React: a popular library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: a JavaScript extension that adds static typing and facilitates development.
- Redux: a library for managing the application state and data storage.
- SCSS: a CSS preprocessor that allows the use of variables, mixins, and other convenient features for styling the interface.

By using these technologies, you will be able to create powerful and modular code, ensuring fast development and easy maintenance. Pay attention to best practices for web interface development, such as code separation into components, the use of Redux for state management, and TypeScript for typing, which facilitates debugging and code extension.
